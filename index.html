<h2>HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS</h2>
<section>
         <p>IN OUR DAILY ASTRONOMICAL LIFE WE ALWAYS ASK THE QUESTION HOW SOME ASTRONOMICAL BODIES WERE 
CREATED .THERE ARE SO MANY THEORY ABOUT HOW SOME HEAVENLY BODIES LIKE PLANETS,COMETS,ASTREOIDS,
STARS ETC WERE CREATED OR BROUGHT INTO EXISTANCE, SO TODAY I WILL BE SHOWING YOU SOME FACTS ABOUT HOW
THE ENTIRE MULTIVERSE WAS CREATED</p>

<p><b>THE UNIVERSE BEGAN WITH AN EXPLOSION OF SPACE ITSELF.THIS EXPLOSION IS KNOW AS THE <u>BIG BANG</u>.THE BIG BANG OCCURED 13.8 BILLION YEARS
AGO WHEN THE UNIVERSE BEGAN AS A TINY, DENSE, FIREBALL THAT EXPLODED.DUE TO EXTREMELY HIGH DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE, SPACE EXPANDED, THE UNIVERSE
COOLED, AND THE SIMPLEST ELEMENTS FORMED. GRAVITY GRADUALLY DREW TOGETHER TO FORM THE FIRST STARS 
AND GALAXIES.  <b>

<h2><li>THE SUN</li></h2>
<p><b>THE SUN IS A STAR AT THE HEART OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. ITS GRAVITY HOLDS THE SOLAR SYSTEM
TOGETHER. THE SUN WAS FORMED 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, WHEN A CLOUD OF DUST AND GAS CALLED A <U>NEBULA</U> COLLAPSED UNDER ITS OWN GRAVITY. 
AS IT DID, THE CLOUD SPUN AND FLATTENED INTO A DISK, WITH OUR SUN FORMING AT ITS CENTER. THE DISKS OUTSKIRTS LATER ACCRETED INTO 
OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, INCLUDING EARTH AND OTHER PLANETS. </b></p>

<h2><li>THE MOON</h2></li>
<P><B>THE MOON IS KNOWN TO BE THE EARTHS ONLY NATURAL SATELLITE. THE MOON IS THE BRIGHTEST CELETIAL OBJECT IN THE SKY DURING THE NIGHT 
AND THE SOURCE OF ITS LIGHT IS FROM THE SUN(THE MOON REFLECTS THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN).
ACCORDING TO SCIENTIST THE MOON IS SAID TO HAVE FORMED IN A TREMENDOUS COLLISION KNOW AS <U>THE COLLISION RING</U>.
A MASSIVE OBJECT CALLED <U>THEIA</U> WHICH IS NAMED AFTER A MYTHOLOGICAL GREEK TITAN
WHO IS THE SAID TO BE THE GODDESS OF THE MOON.THIS OBJECT CALLED THEIA SMASHED INTO EARTH AND STARTED 
FLINGING ROCKS INTO SPACE. THESE ROCKS STARTED REVOLVING AROUND THE EARTH AND LATER ON FORMED THE MOON.</B></P>

<h2><li>THE EARTH</li></h2>
<p><b>THE EARTH IS THE THIRD PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND ALSO KNOWN AS THE FIFTH LARGEST PLANET.
THE EARTH IS THE ONLY PLANET IN THE UNIVERSE KNOWN AND CONFIRMED TO HOST LIFE. IT IS ALSO THE ONLY PLANET
KNOWN FOR SURE TO CONTAIN OR HAVE LIQUID WATER ON ITS SURFACE. THE EARTHED FORMED OVER 4.6 BILLION 
YEAR AGO OUT OF A MIXTURE OF DUST AND GAS AROUND THE YOUNG SUN. IT GREW LARGER THANKS TO COUNTLESS
COLLISIONS BETWEEN DUST PARTICLES, ASTEROIDS, AND OTHER GROWING PLANETS INCLUDING ONE LAST GIANT 
IMPACT THAT THREW ENOUGH ROCK, GAS, AND DUST INTO SPACE TO FORM THE MOON (THE COLLISION RING).</b></p>
